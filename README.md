# RoboCup Junior Line Follower Robot

This repository contains code for a line follower robot designed to compete in the RoboCup Junior competition. The robot is built using an Arduino microcontroller, an Adafruit Motor Shield, and an Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor. The robot uses a line follower array consisting of four sensors that detect the position of the line and adjusts the speed of the motors accordingly to follow the line.

## Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- Adafruit Motor Shield library
- Adafruit TCS34725 library
- LineFollowerArray library

## Getting Started
To use this code, connect the Adafruit Motor Shield and the Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor to your Arduino board as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then, upload the code to your board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
The robot is designed to compete in the RoboCup Junior competition, where it will need to follow a black line on a white surface. If the color sensor detects the color red, the robot will need to stop. The robot will need to complete the course as quickly as possible, while staying on the line and avoiding obstacles.

## About RoboCup Junior
RoboCup Junior is a competition for students aged 19 and under that challenges them to build and program robots that can compete in a variety of events, including line following, soccer, rescue, and dance. The competition is designed to encourage young people to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields and to promote teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving skills.
