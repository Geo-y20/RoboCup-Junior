    <h1>Line Follower Robot Code</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for a line follower robot. The code is written in Arduino and controls the motors and color sensor using an Adafruit Motor Shield and an Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor. The robot is equipped with a line follower array consisting of four sensors that detect the position of the line, and adjusts the speed of the motors accordingly to follow the line.</p>
    <h2>RoboCup Junior Competition</h2>
    <p>This project was developed for the <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/" target="_blank">RoboCup Junior competition</a>, which is an international robotics competition designed to introduce students to STEM concepts through robotics.</p>
    <p>The line follower robot is a popular competition category in RoboCup Junior. The objective of the competition is to design and build a robot that can follow a black line on a white surface as quickly and accurately as possible. The robot must be autonomous and can only use sensors to detect the line.</p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino IDE</li>
      <li>Adafruit Motor Shield library</li>
      <li>Adafruit TCS34725 library</li>
      <li>LineFollowerArray library</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To use this code, connect the Adafruit Motor Shield and the Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor to your Arduino board as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then, upload the code to your board using the Arduino IDE.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The robot will follow a black line on a white surface. If the color sensor detects the color red, the robot will stop.</p>
    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>This code was written by [Your Name]. The LineFollowerArray library was developed by [Name of the developer].</p>
